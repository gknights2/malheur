# Malheur
Malheur is an FPS where you need to defend a wildlife refuge from government agents while ensuring your LSD shipments arrive on time.

It will be created in Python with Blender 2.79a.

There will be a single .blend file along with some supporting scripts for people who want to do modding.

Enjoy!
